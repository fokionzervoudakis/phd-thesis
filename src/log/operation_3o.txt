Building model...

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 71 iterations in 0.02 seconds (average 0.000310, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.03 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      71 (1 initial)
Transitions: 71

Transition matrix: 2588 nodes (2 terminal), 71 minterms, vars: 29r/29c

Prob0: 71 iterations in 0.02 seconds (average 0.000268, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 71, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.02 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
