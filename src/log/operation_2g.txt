Model checking: P=? [ F d3=0&d5=0 ]

Building model...

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 120 iterations in 0.05 seconds (average 0.000442, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.325 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      120 (1 initial)
Transitions: 120

Transition matrix: 5292 nodes (2 terminal), 120 minterms, vars: 43r/43c

Prob0: 120 iterations in 0.07 seconds (average 0.000617, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 120, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.072 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
