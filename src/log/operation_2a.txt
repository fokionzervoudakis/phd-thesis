Building model...

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 109 iterations in 0.13 seconds (average 0.001220, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.204 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      2800 (1 initial)
Transitions: 5599

Transition matrix: 2541 nodes (3 terminal), 5599 minterms, vars: 31r/31c

Prob0: 109 iterations in 0.20 seconds (average 0.001789, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 2800, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.202 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
