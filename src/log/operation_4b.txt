Building model...

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 121 iterations in 0.03 seconds (average 0.000207, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.225 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      196 (1 initial)
Transitions: 266

Transition matrix: 3024 nodes (4 terminal), 266 minterms, vars: 28r/28c

yes = 0, no = 196, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 0.0

Time for model checking: 0.0070 seconds.

Result: 0.0 (value in the initial state)
