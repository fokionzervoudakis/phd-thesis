Model checking: P=? [ F d2=0 ]

Building model...

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 91 iterations in 0.05 seconds (average 0.000571, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.392 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      91 (1 initial)
Transitions: 91

Transition matrix: 4675 nodes (2 terminal), 91 minterms, vars: 47r/47c

Prob0: 91 iterations in 0.04 seconds (average 0.000429, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 91, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.04 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
