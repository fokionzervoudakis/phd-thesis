Model checking: P=? [ F d1=0 ]

Building model...

Computing reachable states...

Reachability (BFS): 70 iterations in 0.01 seconds (average 0.000171, setup 0.00)

Time for model construction: 0.034 seconds.

Type:        DTMC
States:      70 (1 initial)
Transitions: 70

Transition matrix: 720 nodes (2 terminal), 70 minterms, vars: 14r/14c

Prob0: 70 iterations in 0.01 seconds (average 0.000086, setup 0.00)

Prob1: 1 iterations in 0.00 seconds (average 0.000000, setup 0.00)

yes = 70, no = 0, maybe = 0

Value in the initial state: 1.0

Time for model checking: 0.0070 seconds.

Result: 1.0 (value in the initial state)
